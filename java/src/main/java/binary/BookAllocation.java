// Problem:
// You are given an array of integers representing books and an integer k representing the number of students.
// The books are arranged in order, and each book has pages[i]. You must allocate books to k students such that each
// student gets a contiguous block of books, and the maximum pages allocated to a student is minimized. 
// Return that minimum value.

// Example:
// Input: pages = [12, 67,34, 90], k = 2
// Possible allocations: 
// [12], [67, 34, 90], max = 191
// [12, 67], [34, 90], max = 124
// [12, 67, 34], [90], max = 113
// Output: 113
// (Allocate [12, 34, 67] and [90] â†’ max = 113)

// Alternate statement:
// You have a fixed, linear sequence of tasks, where the input array T defines the effort required for each task in order.
// You must divide this sequence of tasks among exactly K workers.
//
// The Constraints:
// Each worker must be assigned a contiguous block of tasks (i.e., you cannot skip tasks in the sequence).
// The sum of tasks assigned to any single worker is that worker's total workload.
//
// The Goal: Find the specific way to divide the sequence into K blocks such that the largest total workload carried
// by any single worker is as small as possible. Return this minimized maximum workload.
